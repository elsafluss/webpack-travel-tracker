# TRAVEL TRACKER

## This is a faux travel agency website, where you can sign in, view all your trips, and create a new trip.

You'll need to pull down the files and run the API, then go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.

Log in with username `traveler##` and `travel2020` where the ## are any number 01 - 50.

View past and future trips, pending and approved trips, see how much that user spent in 2020 on travel, and create a new trip. New trips get posted to the API, isn't that neat?

## Running  Tests
To run the tests, comment out the first two includes blocks in trip.js, then use npm test. If I'd used chai spies you wouldn't have to do this.

This site was created to [this spec](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/travel-tracker.html) as my mod2 final solo project.
Link to the API can also be found in the spec sheet.

I built this with 8 fingers, 6 days, Webpack, Sass, JavaScript, PG Tips tea, a heated blanket, and stress. There are issues in the project board that I would tackle if I had more time. Go ahead and work on one, or log a bug. 

I listened to [this Prodigy Album](https://open.spotify.com/album/05yevdRXvaX6KGRaZehaDW?si=gfFOWavmQemIGf9sEPmIPA) nonstop for three days to build this site. Highly recommend.

This was the first solo project that I did at Turing that really made me feel like a software engineer. I had to solve all the problems myself, which was good because I created most of them :)

I was proud of the local storage solution for holding the current trip's data between the time when the user calculates the trip's cost and when they book the trip.
